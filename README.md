## My personal portfolio

## URL / Live version

## Future ideas
Currently being served as a static website. 

I'm currently working on a completely new version in which I'm using the MERN stack to add more functionalities to the site. 

Such functionalies are: 

- A blog.
- All my projects live versions hosted on the same domain.
- And other cool things!
